## Practical Programs

### A1) Addition of Two Numbers

**Introduction:**  
Event handling in JavaScript allows actions when a user interacts with a webpage. This program demonstrates addition of two numbers dynamically when a button is clicked.

**Code File:** `Addition.html`

**Expected Output:**  
- User enters two numbers → clicks **Add** → result displayed dynamically.

### A2) Moving Train Program (Animation)

**Introduction:**  
Demonstrates movement of an image when a button is clicked using JavaScript event handling.

**Code File:** `MovingTrain.html`

**Expected Output:**  
- Image moves to the right on each click.

### A3) Form Validation Using JavaScript

**Introduction:**  
Validates user input in a form before submission. Checks include required fields, email format, and password length.

**Code File:** `FormValidation.html`

**Expected Output:**  
- Validates inputs → alerts user if invalid → successful submission if valid.  

**Screenshot:**
